These are the libraries used by the WPI Robotics program. Some are written in house and others are borrowed from other sources.
To add these libraries to your own arduino install:

1. Create a libraries folder in your arduino sketchbook.

2. Copy paste the library folders into the folder you just made.

Sketchbook/libraries/serveral library folders

3. Restart arduino and try out some of the exmple code by selecting File>Examples>Library>file
